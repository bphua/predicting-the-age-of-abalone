## Abstract
<!-- A one paragraph summary of what you set out to learn, and what you ended up finding. It should summarise the entire report. -->


## Introduction
<!-- A discussion of what questions you are trying to answer. -->


## Data Set
<!-- Describe details about how the data set was collected (if known) and the variables in the data set. -->

### Importing Data

```{r import}
library(tidyverse)
library(gridExtra)
data = read.table("https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/abalone.data", sep = ",")
```

### Cleaning 
```{r}
library(reshape)
new_names <- c("Sex", "Length", "Diameter", "Height", "Whole_weight", "Shucked_weight", "Viscera_weight", "Shell_weight", "Rings")

colnames(data) <- new_names

# Lenghts, Diameter, Height in mm
# Weight in grams

# check for outliers
melt(data) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = variable, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot() + facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = "free") 

# looks like a signifant outlier in height that we may want to remove. 

# check weights
data %>%
  mutate(sum_weight = Shell_weight + Viscera_weight + Shucked_weight) %>%
  summarise(bad = sum(sum_weight > Whole_weight)) 


```


## Analysis
<!-- Describe how you used multiple regression to analyse the data set. Specifically, you should discuss how you carried out the steps in analysis discussed in class, i.e., exploration of data to find an initial reasonable model, checking the model and changes to the model based on your checking of the model. -->
```{r}
# basic testing - to get a feel for things - not necessarily for preso or report

# some stats
data %>%
  group_by(Sex) %>%
  summarize(mean_wgt = mean(Whole_weight), mean_lenght = mean(Length), mean_rings = mean(Rings), min_rings = min(Rings), max_rings = max(Rings))

# correlation pairs:
library(GGally)
#ggpairs(data)   # function takes a long time to execute.

# how many of each sex, m/f/infant
data %>%
  group_by(Sex) %>%
  summarize(n = n())


# Full model 
full_model <- lm(Rings ~ ., data = data)
summary(full_model)
t(round(broom::glance(full_model), 2))


```

## Results
<!-- Provide inferences about the questions of interest. -->


## Discussion and Conclusion
<!-- Describe any limitations of your analysis and how they might be overcome in future research and provide brief conclusions about the results of your study. -->
